# WolfieMouse Report Feb, 2017

## How Was 2016 Micromouse Competition

We had [a competiton in 2016](https://meetings.vtools.ieee.org/m/37907). Although
we had some achivements, such as making actual mouse hardware, it was a big fail!
The mouse didn't work in the maze. The main reason was we spent too much time on
doing trials and errors with hardware and couldn't finish driver software parts.

### What we achived

* We completed a PCB design and soldering for a mouse hardware.
* We made a basic algorithm and simulation that actually works.

### What problem we had

* The main problem: We didn't finished making software dirver in time.
* Soldering problem: some part of hardware (display, SD card) didn't work 
due to bad soldering.
* Algorithm: we need to make algorithm for to reduce solving time (e.g. diagnal movement)

## What I did after competiton

I had made some improvement last semester. It was mostly for making project more
approachable.

* Improved driver software. Now the mouse should start working.
* Improved programming environment so that newcommers don't need to struggle 
setting up.

## What we need to do for 2017 competion

The next micromouse competition is around the middle of April. Even though
we already have a working mouse, we are planing to make another mouse with
improved design.

* Attach simulation part with an actual mouse.
* Improve hardware design. There are many things to fix our PCB board.
* Adopt better alorithm.
* Actual test on the maze in our lab.

## WolfieMouse need help!

This project has been done one person. However, this project _cannot_ be done by
one person. I need your help. If you participate you can learn the following but
not limited to:

* Algorithm design
* Embedded system software development (C/C++)
* Hardware redesign, PDB design, and surface-mount device soldering. 
* 3D printing.
* Collaboration tools such as Git.

## Expected timeline and workload

Micromouse is a big project. There are a lot of work needed to finish it in two
month. I will usually have two meetings per week but we may have more work needed.

* Feb - 1st week of March: Get to know about theory. Redesign hardware.
* 2nd week, March: Build a new Micromouse.
* 3rd week, March - to the competition: Test the mouse and improve software.
